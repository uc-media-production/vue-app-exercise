# The Source Directory

This directory contains all of the files needed to render your website. This includes components, views, routes, and more. These files _need_ to be compilied first so the browser can read them. The browser has no idea how to read `.vue` files.

If you have static files (like `.html` files for example), they can be moved into the `public` folder.
