# The Views Directory

This directory contains all of the "views" or single webpages that are part of your website. It's important to note that, every "view" needs to have a "route" associated with it.

These views are tied to a specific URL. When that URL is visited, the respective component is loaded.

> NOTE: If you have components that are reused across multiple views, add them to the "components" folder
